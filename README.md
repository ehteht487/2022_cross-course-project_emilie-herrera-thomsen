Conscious Coffee. 
The assignment was to create a web site for a brand of coffee called Conscious Coffee.

## Description
The original assignment was to create a page using only HTML and CSS. The page had to contain a homepage, an about page, a contact page and a list of locations for the coffee shops. The HTML had to be semantic and the CSS should follow the dry principle. In later assignments I had to use JavaScript to create form validation on the contact page, and I had to connect to a WordPress API to fetch a list of products. The WordPress API was created on another page using a webhost, but the products were displayed on the Netlify page connected to this repository.
