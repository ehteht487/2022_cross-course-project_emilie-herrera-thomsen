                <h1>A fairtrade coffee brand</h1>
                <p>This means that every step of the coffee making process, from plant to cup, is made with the people producing the coffee in mind. The farmers get wage and pricing additions to make sure they can build better living and working conditions for themselves, and produce great quality coffee. It also means making sure the release of greenhouse gasses is kept to a minimum to avoid contributing to global warming. So enjoy a cup of our delicious coffee - with a clear conscious! </p>

                    <p>Developing countries make up more than 90 percent of the worldâ€™s coffee production. To help make sure the farmers are paid fairly in every corner of the world, we get our coffee from small farms in Asia, Africa and Central-and South America.</p>

                    <h2>Sustainable</h2>
                    <p>Our production locations in Norway release no green house gasses. The gasses made from production are cleaned and the used for other purposes. The energy for both production and shop locations come from solar panels, and all the materials used in our shops are bio-degradable.</p>

                <h2>Best beans</h2>
                <p>We use the Arabica bean in our production. This is the most popular type in the world- for a reason! This is a fruity and sugary bean, making it rich in aroma and not too bitter. Try one of our many flavours and see for yourself!</p>
