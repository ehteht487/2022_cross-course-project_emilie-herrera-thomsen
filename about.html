              <h1>About us</h1>
              <p>Conscious Coffee opened our first coffee shop in Bergen, Norway more than 30 years ago. We knew that coffee already was an essential part of the daily life almost every adult Norwegian, but we noticed that people wanted to be more conscious about from who and where they got their coffee. That is why is why we opened our first Conscious Coffee shop, so that people could know with certainty that the beverages they consumed were made from organic, fair-trade products</p>

              <p>We know that a cup of coffee is not just a hot drink, it is something to keep you warm and awake on your way to work, it is the perfect date and it is something to share while catching up with friends. That is why we felt confident while opening up our second shop to the people of Oslo just 5 years after the first, and from then on we have opened up more than fifteen new shops all across Norway.</p>
